## Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- [OPA Open Policy Agent ðŸŒŸ](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) 
- OPA is most often used as an admission controller in Kubernetes. An admission controller is where all the semantic validation of Kubernetes resources occur before resources are persisted to etcd and controllers go off and start doing work.

- [k8s-security-policies](https://github.com/raspbernetes/k8s-security-policies) This repository provides a security policies library that is used for securing Kubernetes clusters configurations. The security policies are created based on CIS Kubernetes benchmark and rules defined in Kubesec.io. The policies are written in Rego, a high-level declarative language, its purpose-built for expressing policies over complex hierarchical data structures. For detailed information on Rego see the Policy Language documentation.

Securely manage workloads on your kubernetesio clusters with this handy new tool, Kyverno.Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

- [kyverno.io: Check deprecated APIs ðŸŒŸ](https://kyverno.io/policies/best-practices/check_deprecated_apis/) Kubernetes APIs are sometimes deprecated and removed after a few releases. As a best practice, older API versions should be replaced with newer versions. This policy validates for APIs that are deprecated or scheduled for removal. Note that checking for some of these resources may require modifying the Kyverno ConfigMap to remove filters.
